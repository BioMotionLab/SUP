Realistic virtual characters are important for many applications. The [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de) body model is based on 3D body scans and uses bodyshape and pose-dependent blendshapes to achieve realistic human animations.  Recently, a large database of SMPL animations called [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de) has been released. Here, we present a tool that allows these animations to be viewed and controlled in Unity called the BioMotionLab SMPL Unity Player (bmlSUP). This tool provides an easy interface to load and display AMASS animations in 3D immersive environments and mixed reality.

If you use bmlSUP please [cite us](Publication.md), as well as both [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de) and [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de).

The bmlSUP player can only be used for non-commercial purposes, and falls under the same license agreement as AMASS and SMPL.

## First steps

Install the package following these [Instructions](Installation.md).

Check out the [Overview](Overview.md).

Open the [GUI Viewer Sample scene](documentation/gui/guiloading.md), and enjoy viewing animations!
