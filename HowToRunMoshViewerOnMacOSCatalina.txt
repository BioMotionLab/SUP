# To run MoshViewer Unity Program on macOS Catalina

Because of apple's crazy policies, you can't open un-notorized apps by default. You will need to use terminal to modify its executable status.

Move the MoshViewer.app file into the applications folder.

Make sure it's not in a subfolder. Open terminal.

Type:

chmod +x /Applications/MoshViewer.app/Contents/MacOS/*

Try to open it, you'll still get an error. Go to System Preferences > Security and allow the app. Try opening again.
